# Description
A RESTFUL JWKS serves that provides public keys with unique identifiers for verifying JWTS with expirations.



# AI Usage Paragraph
Throughout this assignment, AI was used to assist me with specific commands and code to achieve better outcomes. Throughout the process, I had to learn how to create a RESTful JWKS server, as I had never done so before. So, with AI, I knew what a JSON Web Key Set is and how to implement it. Some of the prompts that I used to provide more effective answers were "With these current errors, please explain what is wrong in a detailed bullet point and provide alternative ways to improve on it." AI allowed me to learn at a faster pace and provided me detail explanations on how everything works. Also, a huge issue I faced when using AI was that I kept getting the same answer for a while, which was a human error: I forgot to refresh my port whenever submitting new code. So with AI, I was able to write commands to check whether any node was running and kill it, so I can make sure the node is checking the new code.
